# The Brachistochrone Problem - Calculus II Honors Project

## Overview
A 26-page honors paper investigating the **Brachistochrone problem** — determining the curve of fastest descent between two points under gravity.

The project includes historical analysis, a full mathematical derivation using principles from the calculus of variations, and physical simulation to validate the result.

The final result shows that the curve of fastest descent is a **cycloid**, not a straight line.

This project reflects long-form mathematical reasoning, structured proof development, and the ability to connect abstract theory with physical experimentation.
